The primary objective of this project is to train a predictive Gaussian process 
model for reservoir model and characterizations. In particular, the trained GP will
serve as the adopted computation model within the proposed digital twin for a reservoir
which is the corresponding physical twin. 


### Experimental Results
We demonstrated the use of GP to model simple reservoir behaviors, specifically 
for the reservoir pressure behaviors and the oil production rate. We also demonstrate
a simple implementation of GP via spectral sampling.
